Why do you think he used different threads for different rules?
Well, they aren't. They have set snakemake to take up the threads (snakemake makes this
amount of cores available when the job is run), but never actually
instruct the program to use the available threads. So the rule uses multiple threads, but
the tool only uses 1.

What would you recommend the writer to improve his script?
First off, use the available cores by using the --threads argument or the equivalent for
the tools that are used.
I would also recommend putting the scripts in thier own directory (workflow/scripts).
I'm also pritty sure there should be a .gitignore so that things like .snakemake don't 
end up in the repo.
