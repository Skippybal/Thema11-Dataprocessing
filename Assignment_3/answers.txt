How is the input output construction handled in case of a database?
The database is created with a fasta file that is given by the filtered directory and then the file that is created by the filterFasta rule
The out put is the files that are the output of the makeblastdb shell command.

Both clearDB and loadBlasts uses a fake file. It creates a file with touch as output so that when the rule is finished the file will exist,
then this can be used to confirm is the job was done by another rule. This file is then removed in the next rule seeing as the input 
does not contain any usefull information.

How is de Snakefile documented?
The documentation is done using the message subsection of the rules.

What would you improve in this script?
Maybe try and group some rules together and make smaller modules that serve a specific purpose like building the database.
